## Javascript operations

JavaScript operations, also known as operators, are symbols or keywords that allow you to perform various actions on values. These actions can include mathematical calculations, logical comparisons, string manipulation, and more. Here's a simple explanation of the main types of operations in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**

   - These operators perform mathematical calculations on numerical values.
   - Examples include addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and modulus `%` (which returns the remainder of a division).
   - Example: `let result = 10 + 5; // result will be 15`

2. **Comparison Operators:**

   - These operators compare two values and return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on whether the comparison is true or false.
   - Examples include equal to `==`, not equal to `!=`, greater than `>`, less than `<`, greater than or equal to `>=`, less than or equal to `<=`.
   - Example: `let isGreater = 10 > 5; // isGreater will be true`

3. **Logical Operators:**

   - These operators perform logical operations on boolean values and return a boolean result.
   - Examples include AND `&&`, OR `||`, and NOT `!`.
   - Example: `let result = (10 > 5) && (5 < 3); // result will be false`

4. **Assignment Operators:**

   - These operators are used to assign values to variables.
   - Examples include assignment `=`, addition assignment `+=`, subtraction assignment `-=`.
   - Example: `let x = 10; // assigns the value 10 to the variable x`

5. **Unary Operators:**

   - These operators operate on a single operand.
   - Examples include increment `++`, decrement `--`, negation `-`.
   - Example: `let x = 5; x++; // x will become 6`

6. **String Operators:**

   - The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate strings (join strings together).
   - Example: `let greeting = 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World'; // greeting will be 'Hello World'`

7. **Type Operators:**
   - These operators are used to determine the type of a value.
   - Example: `typeof 5; // returns 'number'`

These are some of the basic operations you can perform in JavaScript. Understanding how to use these operators effectively allows you to write more expressive and functional code.
